## Intended Use
### Value of Best Remediated Model
The remediated model, based on data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), is designed solely for educational purposes. It tests for biases between men and women, as well as races such as black vs. white and other demographic categories in the dataset. The primary goal of this model is to serve as a learning tool for students to understand and practice identifying and addressing biases in data. This model is not built to resolve a real-world problem. However, by engaging in such practices in a similar real-world project, a remediated model can help the project achieve some of the following potential values:
-	**Market-Leading Status:** Enhances reputation through fair lending practices.
-	**Obligations to Lenders/Creditors:** Ensures compliance with fair lending laws.
-	**Shareholder Returns:** Reduces legal risks and improves customer satisfaction.
-	**Profitability:** Identifies profitable, unbiased lending opportunities.
-	**Sustainability:** Builds trust and loyalty among diverse customers.
-	**Growth Prospects:** Opens new market segments through fair criteria.

### How to Use the Best Remediated Model 
The best remediated model is used for assessing bias and can be used for the following purposes:
- **Intended Scope:** Use for assessing and mitigating biases in mortgage lending.
- **Capabilities and Limitations:** Understand its ability to detect and correct biases.
- **Appropriate Application:** Apply consistently across all demographic groups.
- **Monitoring and Validation:** Regularly check for and adjust new biases.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adhere to fair lending laws (ECOA, FHA).
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Ensure transparency with regulators, lenders, and customers.

### Primary Intended Users
- Students in GWU DNSC_6330 class

### Additional Purposes
- This model is an educational example and cannot be used for any additional purposes.

## Ethical Considerations
### Potential Negative Impacts of Using the Best Remediated Model
- **Biases:** Even with remediation, this model can still exhibit biases such as bias in algorithms or training data. Models might perform well on training data but fail to generalize unseen data, leading to inaccurate predictions in real-world.
- **Model Drift:** Over time, the model’s performance can drift due to changes in the data distribution, necessitating monitoring updates.
- **Unfair Decisions:** The model’s decisions could lead to unfair loan approvals and affect individuals resulting in discrimination in real-world situations.

### Potential Uncertainties Relating to the Impacts of Using the Best Remediated Model
- **Uncertainty in Model Performance:** Despite remediation, there is always uncertainty regarding how well the model will perform in diverse real-world scenarios. Unexpected events such as recession and outbreaks affect model performance.
- **Software Bugs:** Unforeseen bugs or vulnerabilities in software implementation can lead to incorrect model outputs or security risks.
- **Legal Complications:** The model might behave unpredictably when exposed to new types of data or adversarial examples, leading to unintended consequences such as legal penalties.

### Unexpected Results Encountered During Training
- During the training of the model to predict high-priced loans, several unexpected results were observed: the residuals were highly unbalanced, with higher residuals for high-priced loans and lower residuals for non-high-priced loans, indicating the model struggled to accurately predict high-priced loans while performing better for non-high-priced loans. Additionally, there were noticeable outliers, particularly for high-priced loans, suggesting significant prediction errors in certain cases. These findings highlight the need for better model calibration, improved feature engineering, and thorough outlier analysis to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.
